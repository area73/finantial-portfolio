## Future Improvements

Due to limited time and scope, some features and improvements have been left out of the scope for this project.

I didn't add a dropdown to select dates or a range date section since I was focus on representing the graphs.

I did some logic on how to obtain data with parameters from the API but my main goal was to demonstrate the use of these calls and how they interact with the UI

Below are some improvements that could be implemented in the future:

- Centralized config file to store URLS and colors used on the app (for graphs)
- Add Type safe validation for schemas like Zod
  Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. It is designed to help developers define and enforce the structure of data in their applications, ensuring that the data conforms to expected formats and types. Zod is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to validate user input, API responses, or configuration objects.
